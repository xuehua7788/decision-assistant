That's completely normal.\n\nLet's break it down together, step by step. You don't have to face it all at once.\n\nCould you tell me a little about what makes this decision feel \"very hard\"? For example:\n- Are you unsure about what you really want?\n- Do you feel pressured by others or by time?\n- Are you worried about potential negative outcomes?\n\nYou don't have to go into detail if you're not comfortableâ€”just share whatever feels manageable.
