I'm here and ready to help with your decision-making needs. \n\nSince you're testing the integration, I'd be happy to demonstrate how I can assist with analytical decision support. For example, I could:\n\n- Help break down a complex decision into manageable parts\n- Create pros/cons lists for different options\n- Identify potential risks and opportunities\n- Suggest frameworks for evaluating alternatives\n\nDo you have a specific decision you'd like to work through, or would you prefer me to walk through a sample scenario to showcase the capabilities?\n\nI'm here to provide clear, structured, and thoughtful guidance whenever you're ready!",
